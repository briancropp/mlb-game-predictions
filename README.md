# Weather, Travel, and Baseball: Markov Chain Simulation of Major League Baseball Games

### Purpose
The purpose of this study is to explore the game of baseball with a focus on how weather and travel impact a team’s performance. 

### Background 
Long before the Hollywood hit Moneyball popularized statistical analysis in Major League Baseball, Bill James coined the term ‘sabermetrics’ in 1980 to define “the search for objective knowledge about baseball” .The history of the statistics in baseball really dates back to as early as 1925 when F.C. Lane published his book Batting, where he developed theories on how mathematics can tell something about the game of baseball. Using the new and advanced tools for statistical analysis developing today, new exploration can further examine the sport of professional baseball. All you need is some statistical background and a love of the game.

### Methods
This studied relied on data pertaining to Major League Baseball play-by-play performance, weather data specific to games, and travel data unique to the professional teams. With this data collected, methods of predicting the overall game outcome (game score, the winning team, and the losing team) in an effort to improve accuracy were tested. This study used a specific simulation process call Markov Chain simulation that has been popularized in other Major League Baseball game analysis.
